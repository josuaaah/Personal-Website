  I am a third-year Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore.
  I specialize in Artificial Intelligence, am pursuing a Second Major in Statistics, 
  and am also part of the University Scholar's Programme (USP). A perk of having me 
  as a software developer: I write very, very, very clean code. Outside of Computing, 
  I have a soft spot for fantasy novels, and I used to make music covers before I got busy. 
  Hope we have a chance to connect soon!`;
