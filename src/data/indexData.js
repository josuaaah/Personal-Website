  I am a third-year Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore.
  I specialize in Artificial Intelligence, am pursuing a Second Major in Statistics, 
  and am also part of the University Scholar's Programme (USP). I am passionate in 
  creating things - literally anything!

  I also have a soft spot for fantasy novels, and I used to make music covers a lot 
  before I got busy. Hope we can get in touch soon!`;
